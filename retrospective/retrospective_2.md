### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| #0 Cross-functional Tasks  |   12   |   -   |    45h 30m        |     50h 45m         |  
| #4 Browse Application  |    6     |    3   |    14h        |     12h 35m         | 
| #5 Accept Application     |   5      |    13    |     11h 30m       |      9h 55m        |
| #6 Browse Application Decisions      |    7     |    3    |     17h      |      15h 25m        |
| #7 Browse Proposals      |    5     |    5    |     11h      |      9h 30m        |
| #8 Update Proposals      |    5     |    13    |    15h 30m      |     15h         |


<br><br>
- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual) 
<br>Hours per task average (estimate) = 2h 52m /task
<br>Hours per task average (actual) =  2h 50m /task
<br>Standard deviation (estimate) = 2.63
<br>Standard deviation (actual) = 2.78

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 = 0.01 => 1%

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 10h 
  - Total hours spent: 9h 30m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 68 (new), 115(total)
  - Coverage (if available): 96% statement coverage
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 11h
  - Total hours spent: 8h 45m
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 5h
  - Total hours spent: 7h 5m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  > The main error encountered during the planning phase stemmed from the fact that we underestimated the time required for learning, necessary to effectively complete certain tasks. 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  > A good initial plan significantly facilitates the progress of work. Working within a broader time frame, for example, not limiting ourselves to completing tasks in the last days before the demo, has led to an increased flexibility and a better response to errors.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  > We definitely made a better plan compared to last time, relying on the individual experience of each group member, we managed to identify issues and balanced the sprint accordingly. We emphasized working better by using GitHub, opening many issues even for small changes. Finally, we worked by distributing the workload more evenly during the sprint period, allowing us to reach the last days before the demo with a completed project ready to be tested end-to-end.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > 1. We want everyone to be able to actively participate in the upcoming demos and retrospectives, presenting the work done.


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  > We have accomplished what we set out to improve.

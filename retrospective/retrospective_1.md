  <br>Stories committed: 3
  <br>Stories done: 3
- Total points committed vs. done
  <br>Points committed: 18
  <br>Points done: 18
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
  <br>Hours planned: 117h 10m
  <br>Hours spent: 119h 2m

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| #0 Cross-functional Tasks  |   19   |   -   |    82h 30m        |     75h 02m         | 
| #1 Insert Proposal   |      8   |    5   |    11h 10m        |     11h 40m         | 
| #2 Search Proposal     |   13      |    8    |     16h 50m       |      27h 45m        |
| #3 Apply for proposal      |   6      |    5    |     6h 40m      |      4h 35m        |



- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
<br>Hours per task average (estimate) = 2h 32m /task
<br>Hours per task average (actual) = 2h 35m /task
<br>Standard deviation (estimate) = 4.08
<br>Standard deviation (actual) = 3.9

- Total task estimation error ratio: 1 - sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent = 0.05 => 5%

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2h 
  - Total hours spent: 9h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 47
  - Coverage (if available): 90% statement coverage
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 3h 
  - Total hours spent: 1h 30m
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 1h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  > Initially, we tried to estimate fewer hours, considering the possibility of encountering issues or making incorrect estimates. We underestimated the frontend development, which took more hours than expected due to several ongoing changes. Managing the APIs also took more time than anticipated because the need arose to create additional APIs that were not initially planned, or to modify the database. Lastly, we spent a lot of time in learning phase and trying to implement the external authentication.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  > We have learned greater adaptability in responding to needs from other team members. We used Github in a more efficient way, raising issues in order to avoid conflicts. Better comunication between team members improved less errors and time wasted.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  > We improve our comunication, sharing some core task management in order to reach an agreement.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  > We planned again badly, we spent so much time in estimation and we did many mistakes, we understimated some tasks and we overrated others, in the end the former required a large amount of time to be implemented and the latter were much easier.
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > 1) Better initial planning.
  > 2) Work even better on GitHub.
  > 3) Do not work the most in the last days.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  > Great adaptability and excellent teamwork.

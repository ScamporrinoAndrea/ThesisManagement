<br><br>
- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual) 
<br>Hours per task average (estimate) = 2h 19m
<br>Hours per task average (actual) =  2h 17m
<br>Standard deviation (estimate) = 2.96
<br>Standard deviation (actual) = 2.00

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 => 0.9%

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  > We have estimated the hours satisfactorily, with a difference between the planned and actual working hours amounting to only one hour. We can consider ourselves very pleased with this achievement in the final sprint.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  > We have learned the importance of maintaining a well-organized and low-debt development environment. This has greatly aided us in expanding the project, incorporating new features without disrupting the basic structure. Instead, we have been able to reuse components in a versatile manner, which is a significant advantage for the maintainability of our system

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  > Every team member has exposed a feature of the project in the demo, and furthermore, we increased our reliability as planned by writing more integration tests.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  > We didn't encounter any additional issues to resolve.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  > We have finished the demos

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  > We are very proud of the level of interoperability developed within our team. Each one of us has been a fundamental pillar for the structure of our project. Many of us have challenged ourselves, stepping out of our comfort zones, as seen in the case of presentations during the demos. We are also very proud of the final result; in our opinion, the project is both beautiful and functional."
